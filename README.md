### User Interface (UI)

The UI design of this mobile application is implemented using tailwinds css with
react native. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes styling faster
and more consistent. It comes with a huge library of predefined classes that can be
used directly on React Native components, so you don't have to write a lot of custom
CSS. This simplified method leads to better code, faster styling, and design
techniques that work well together.
